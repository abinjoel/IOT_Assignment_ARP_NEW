This experiment was done to design a simple LAN in Cisco Packet Tracer and understand how the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) works. ARP is used to map an IP address to a MAC address so that devices in the same network can communicate. In the setup, two PCs were connected through a switch and tested using the ping command. The ARP protocol automatically resolved the IP to MAC mapping, updated the ARP table, and allowed successful communication between the PCs.
