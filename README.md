Aim
To design and implement a simple Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet
Tracer, and to study the concept and operation of the Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) for communication between devices on the same network.

Problem Statement
In computer networks, devices within the same LAN must communicate efficiently. However, communication requires mapping an IP address (logical address) to a
corresponding MAC address (physical address). This process is handled by the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). The problem is to construct a basic LAN using
available networking devices in Cisco Packet Tracer and analyze how ARP works in
establishing communication between devices.

Result
The simple LAN was successfully constructed in Cisco Packet Tracer. When one PC
sent a ping request to another, the ARP protocol automatically resolved the
destination deviceâ€™s IP address to its MAC address. The ARP table on each PC was
updated with this mapping, confirming that ARP is functioning correctly. Hence, successful communication between PCs in the LAN was achieved, and the operation
of ARP was verified.
